A school project for computer graphics class:

Environment: webGL

Includes a 3D model of our college, with important places tagged so you can find the shortest path to them.

DONE:
 - modeled the first floor of our college
 - made .obj to JSON convertion script
 - imported JSON to WebGL
 - implemented simple moving around

TODO:
 - get directional or spot light to work normally
 - collision detection and simple physics
 - try to get SpiderGL working with the college model
 - make a few simple animations (vending machine, sliding and regular doors)
 - put some nice textures on our model
